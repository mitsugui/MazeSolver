Stone Automata Maze Challenge
We welcome you to a new SigmaGeek challenge, now aimed at recognizing talented developers with the potential to join Stone's technology team! 

INTRODUCTION

In this challenge, the goal will be to walk through mazes of cellular automata.

A cellular automaton is a collection of cells in a matrix that evolve over time according to a set of rules defined by the state of the neighboring cells.

It is therefore a powerful computational tool, capable of representing evolutionary systems in a very efficient way.

It can be used to simulate applications in evolutionary biology, the dynamics of chemical reactions, cryptography, the behavior of markets, dynamic systems in physics, anthropology, political science, among other applications.

We hope you have fun and learn as you solve the different levels in this challenge, which will increase in difficulty as you complete.


CHALLENGE RULES

The challenge is individual, okay? We expect you to solve it using your knowledge and to write your own algorithms. If we have a participant who has used identical or very similar code to someone who is also competing, they may be disqualified.

You cannot submit more than one solution and multiple accounts are not allowed. Therefore, please work very carefully before submitting your answers for each phase.

If you are part of Stone's team, your participation is also welcome; we will have a ranking and awards specifically for Stone collaborators and, in this case, you must register on the platform using Stone's corporate email.

Speed in submitting answers will not be considered for ranking. So, work calmly. But don't leave it to submit at the last moment, because we may overload the servers, harming those who have not yet sent the solution.


PHASES OF THE CHALLENGE

03/17/2023 (11AM - Bras√≠lia time): Opening of the 1st phase, which will have two stages that will happen simultaneously, Those who pass the 1st stage (game), will have access to the 2nd stage, which will require a little more complex programming.

03/31/2023: End of phase 1 and announcement of the people approved for phase 2.

04/03/2023 (11am): Opening of the 2nd phase.

04/07/2023 (11:59pm): Closing of 2nd phase.

04/10/2023: Results will be announced.


AWARDS

The prizes will be awarded according to the following table: 

1st place: BRL 4,000.00 +100 SigmaPoints
2nd place: BRL 1,500.00 + 90 SigmaPoints
3rd place: BRL 1,000.00 + 60 SigmaPoints
4th to 10th place: BRL 500.00 + 30 SigmaPoints

People who work at Stone will have a separate ranking, with the following awards:

1st place: BRL 2,500.00 + 100 SigmaPoints
2nd place: BRL 1000.00 + 90 SigmaPoints
3rd place: BRL 750.00 + 60 SigmaPoints
4th place: BRL 375.00 + 30 SigmaPoints
5th place: BRL 375.00 + 30 SigmaPoints

Note: For your performance to be computed in Stone's internal ranking, you must register on the platform with your corporate e-mail address.

Only participants residing in Brazil will be eligible to receive the cash prize.
